Virtual Currency
------------
The name of the virtual currency is VGC. The program have a starting amount of currency and a starting price. Both of these values are set using the Django administration and admin is also able to change the amount of currency units available even after users enter the market. For example, admin should be able to choose to start the program and set the amount of units of VGC available to 10,000 (or any other number) at a price of $1.00 (or any other number). After users enter the market admin should be able to add or subtract VGC from the market. It should be possible for me to add 90,000 (or any other number) VGC units to the market.
